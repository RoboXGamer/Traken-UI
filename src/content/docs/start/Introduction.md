## What is Traken UI?

Traken UI is a versatile component library for React that helps developers build beautiful, accessible, and highly customizable user interfaces. Our philosophy centers on providing robust foundations while preserving creative freedom.

### Key Features

- **Design Language Fluency**: Adapts to multiple design aesthetics - from playful to minimalist
- **Component Composition**: Built around composition principles for creating complex interfaces from simple parts
- **Built-in Accessibility**: Accessibility is at the core of every component, not an afterthought
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensures functionality across all contexts while enabling sophisticated interactions

## FAQ

### Is Traken UI flexible enough for my project?

Yes! Unlike libraries that lock you into a specific aesthetic, Traken UI components provide robust foundations while remaining endlessly adaptable. Each element can be extended, combined, or transformed without fighting against the library's architecture.

### How is Traken UI different from other component libraries?

While many excellent component libraries exist, Traken UI uniquely balances structure with creative freedom:

- **Other libraries**: Often force developers to choose between rigid systems that limit creative expression or highly customizable frameworks that require significant implementation effort
- **Traken UI**: Provides well-structured components that serve as both foundation and springboard for your creativity

### How does Traken UI handle accessibility?

We've built accessibility into the DNA of every component. This means developers can focus on innovation rather than compliance because accessibility isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's the starting point of our design process.

### What makes Traken UI's documentation special?

Our documentation isn't just instructional; it's inspirational. We showcase not only how components work individually but how they can work together to create cohesive, beautiful experiences.

### Does Traken UI support component composition?

Absolutely! We've constructed our library around the principle of composition rather than inheritance. This approach allows developers to build complex interfaces from simple, predictable parts.

### What is Traken UI's development philosophy?

We're committed to:

- **Continuous Evolution**: Growing alongside emerging patterns and technologies
- **Community Collaboration**: Actively incorporating feedback from developers using Traken UI in real-world projects
- **Ethical Design**: Respecting users' attention, privacy, and agency in our component design
